      <h4><strong>How we came to be</strong></h5>
      <p>Every startup comes with an idea, and every idea comes with a purpose. Our purpose is to help the people in most need of help, the elderly people. <br>

          <strong>Spencer (Co-Founder):</strong><br>
            When I was 15 years old, I interned at a Hong Kong startup called KIN. KIN is devoted to building a pill-sorting machine for elderly people. During my six-month internship, I began to familiarize myself with the everyday struggles of elderly people. Parallel to my internship, I was also working with one of my mentors on increasingly ambitious scientific and problem-solving projects. One day, I brought a new idea to my mentor. Now I felt determined to start solving problems that needed to be solved. I still feel this powerful sense of purpose. <br>
            <br>
            This new sense of purpose changed me. With this new awareness that I wanted to solve problems with my own ideas, I began to see other people’s lives differently. The problems of elderly people are different than I had thought before my experience at KIN. I would never have imagined pills could cause such trouble as I’ve never taken enough pills to get confused. Other problems like communicating with care workers and sorting pills are what really impacts their quality of life. I found out about this problem after visiting my grandparents for dinner, where it seemed to me that their ability to talk has worsened since I last saw them. When my mentor asked me what I wanted to do for my next project, I knew. I created this app and now I see that this kind of simple communication platform can give voice to elderly who struggle with technology. I acknowledge that we can’t turn back time yet, but what we can do is enhance the acuity of elderly people’s senses. We can use technology to restore their dignity and empowerment. Understanding the problem differently can lead to its solution.

          <br><strong>Gabriel (Co-Founder):</strong><br>
          <p>I was fortunate enough to see my great grandmother while she still lived. In her last few months, she transitioned from living in a retirement home to living in a hospital until she passed. In her final years, and especially during her final months, she struggled with basic movement that younger people take for granted, including walking and even more so, speaking. When she spoke, it was clear that she struggled a lot, and her speech came out mumbled and difficult to understand for others. I felt as if there was a method to help her communicate more effectively and with less struggle, her final years would have gone by much more smoothly. When Spencer proposed his idea of an app that would help the elderly to communicate more efficiently. I was reminded of my great-grandmother, and thought of how useful it would have been for her. My wish for this app is to help those who struggle in speaking and give them an easier method in which they can communicate with others.I joined this project because I thought that I could contribute towards developing the app itself. Programming has always been a hobby as mine since I was introduced to game design when I was 11. In the recent years, I have been educated in the GSCE computer science curriculum from Grade 9 to Grade 10, where I studied hardware design and programming in Python.  I am also currently a data science intern at Linerlytica, where I use my programming skills to collect shipping schedules from different companies and compile them into a single website that is available to the public.

        <strong>Cocoon Pitch:</strong><br>
        After Gabriel and Spencer finished their first working prototype, they approached the accelerator Cocoon to assist with scalability, networking, and office space. Together, they made a 10 slide presentation to pitch it to Cocoon. The meeting lasted 30 minutes and was a success.

        <strong>Expansion:</strong><br>
          With the support of Cocoon, Spencer and Gabriel worked to expand the team which would allow both of them to create more fully functional prototypes of apps. First members to join were Matthew Wong and Sally Song, both of which continue to play an essential role to the organisation of the computer programming team and progress in the development of the app. Next to join were Stephen and the Graphic Designers, which help design all the logos and banners for everything related to the company. Edward and Chadwick were next and are responsible for the business and consumer aspect of the company, which includes business models, audience questionnaires, and market analysis. Last to join is the grade 10 computer programming team, all of which came from the ISF grade 10 computer science class.
