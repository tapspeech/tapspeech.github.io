      <div class="overflow">
        <p>There are approximately <b>366,750</b> disabled people in Hong Kong, and <b>20,250</b> people within them deal with speech difficulty. Consequently, these people struggle the most with communicating with their caretakers as they can't express their needs to them. With the advancement of technology, there are plenty of apps in the market that address this issue, however, few are easy for elders who are uncomfortable with technology to use.<br>

        <b> - </b> There are <b>366,750</b> people in Hong Kong struggling with communicating with their caretakers <br>
        <b> - </b> None of the apps created to address this issue are easy for elders to use <br>
        <b> - </b> During the pandemic, masks and video chat makes it harder for them to communicate <br>
        <b> - </b> Communicating with caretakers is crucial to the safety of patients and elders <br>
        <br>
        This issue is becoming increasingly more relevant during the Covid-19 pandemic, as people have to wear masks and use video chat to communicate, so talking to each other has become harder even for us. For elders, verbal communication with their caretakers has become impossible. <br>
        <br>
        Communicating with their caretakers and asking for help are crucial to the health of the patients and elders. Communicative difficulty also affects the efficiency of caretakers, making their jobs more difficult. </p>

        <h4 class="my-3"><strong>Our solution to the problem</strong></h4>
        <div class="overflow">
          <p>Our solution is to create an app that allows the patients to communicate with their caretakers through a touch-activated app that delivers their requests for them. Tapspeech will include two versions, the patients version and the caretaker version, the patient's app gives commands to the caretakers through the app to make communication more convenient. The app will be controlled by the patient’s fingers with the button layout suited for the ergonomics of the hand, allowing for easy control of the app.</p>
